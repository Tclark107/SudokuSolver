    The idea is to use backtracking and recursively generate all possible 
    configurations of numbers from 1 to 9 to fill the empty cells of matrix 
    mat[][]. To do so, for every unassigned cell, fill the cell with a number 
    from 1 to 9 one by one. After filling the unassigned cell check if the 
    matrix is safe or not. If safe, move to the next cell else backtrack for 
    other cases. 


    To check if it is safe to place value num in the cell mat[i][j], 
    iterate through all the columns of row i, rows of column j and the 3*3 
    matrix containing cell (i, j) and check if they already has value num, if
    so return false, else return true.
